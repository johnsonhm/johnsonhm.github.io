<h2 id="evaluatorparticipants">Evaluator Participants</h2>
    <h3>Student Evaluators</h3>
    <p>Caitlyn and Camden are two of my sixth-grade students who evaluated my website. I have them both for two classes every day, reading and writing. Using Google Classroom, I sent an announcement to students about participating in an optional survey. The requirements stated they must complete the survey at home during their own time (not at school). Also, I offered a free “class pass” for those who completed it. Both Caitlyn and Camden are qualified to evaluate this website, since students will be the main users of my classroom website. Camden was using Internet Explorer 10.0 on a Lenovo computer with a cable modem internet connection. Caitlyn was using Google Chrome on a Chromebook and was unsure of which type of internet connection was being used.</p>
    <h3>Parent Evaluators</h3>
    <p>I had three parents evaluate my classroom website. Cher, a mom to one of my sixth-grade students, used Internet Explorer on a Google Chrome HP computer with a cable modem internet connection. Chrissy, a mom of an incoming fifth-grader and also a sixth-grade teacher at my school, used both Google Chrome and Internet Explorer on a Dell desktop with a cable modem internet connection. Using my classroom Twitter and Facebook pages, I sent out an announcement to parents about participating in an optional survey. Both of these parents are qualified to evaluate this website since they are parents of students in the age range that I teach.</p>
    <h3>Teacher Evaluators</h3>
    <p>Sam and Sarah are two sixth-grade teachers at my school. Sam teaches math and social studies to the same group of students I see for reading and writing. Sarah teaches reading and writing to a different group of sixth-graders, but social studies to the same group of students I teach. They are both qualified to evaluate my classroom website since they are knowledgeable about best practices of teaching middle-school students. Sarah used Google Chrome on a Dell desktop with a cable modem internet connection. Sam used Google Chrome on a Macbook Air 2017 (processor 1.8GHz, Mem 8GB) with a corporate / institutional internet connection (our school’s internet).</p>
    <h3><a href="#navigation">Return to top.</a></h3>
<h2 id="summary">Summary of Evaluator's Comments</h2>
    <p>Most evaluators had positive things to say about the website’s design. According to them, the site is clearly and logically divided into sections without a lot of scrolling. The site’s navigation was described as easy, quick, and uniform, with the homepage being linked to all pages. Titles are clear and creative and links to content are clear, easy to find, and in working order. Evaluators explained that the content was very user/kid-friendly, accurate, current, unbiased, and no more than two or three layers deep. One said that, “Most were three layers deep, but I did not find that to be a negative at all, rather logical.” </p>
    <br>
    <p>Overall, they loved the colors and thought they were clean and coordinated well. The text on the website was described as clear and coordinated, but some of the smaller text was a bit hard to read. Most saw no mistakes regarding grammar, spelling, or punctuation, but one did say there were a few typos. In terms of multimedia, pictures were described as clear, concise, and made it easier, but one did mention that some pictures were difficult to understand. Also, all evaluators except for one said that the images loaded quickly and looked normal. One commented that she loved how I had created all the images myself. They did agree that the website was original, but two of the six mentioned that copyright, author, and / or email information was not easily found.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When asked about returning to the website, evaluators agreed that the site encouraged users to return, although one parent mentioned, “I’d return, but there was a LOT there. Great for teachers and students… parents might think it is a lot for them.” Along those same lines, a parent wrote, “Audience seems to be students first… then parents. I loved it as a parent and teacher, but I could see where a parent might think it is a lot.” Even with that being said, the comments about the site’s ability to stimulate thinking, most evaluators agreed the site made them think and want to come back.</p>

<h2 id="links">Links to the Evaluator Data</h2>
    <p>From the given evaluation form, I created a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/J4CdMSkEhTCimkqR2" target="_blank">survey</a> using Google Forms. I shared this with my students on Google Classroom, with parents on my classroom Facebook and Twitter pages, and with other sixth-grade teachers through an email invitation.<br><br>
        This is a Google Sheet that includes the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QuVvtTbjqlATs7EAmbDIIfet2Mo30cvWarq0ognpY-c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">responses</a> from all six evaluators.</p>
    <h3><a href="#navigation">Return to top.</a></h3>
<h2 id="usecases">Use Cases</h2>
    <h3>Student Use Case</h3>
    <p>A student wants to find a game to play in order to practice a reading skill. My website does support this particular use case. For example, if the student wants to practice to practice determining the meaning of unknown words (work on his or her vocabulary), they’d be able to find games to help them practice this skill. From the home screen, he or she can click on “Read It” from the main navigation menu, select “More Skills” from the sub-navigation menu, and then select “Unknown Words”. On that page, students will find a collection of games under the “Play and Practice” section. 
    </p>
    <h3>Parent Use Case</h3>
    <p>A parent wants to find out what assignments were done in class on a day their student was gone. He or she also wants to find out information about upcoming assignments and due dates. My website does support this particular use case. For example, the parent visits the home page. Looking at the embedded calendar, he or she can find an overview of each day’s activities as well as upcoming due dates. If a parent wants more detailed information, he or she can click on a specific date and be taken to an embedded slide with step by step instructions for the activities.
    </p>
    <h3>Teacher Use Case</h3>
    <p>A teacher wants to have a designated spot for each facet of the classroom. A calendar has announcements and links to the activities for each particular day. My website partially supports this use case. My website has a page for each facet of my classroom, but the pages themselves aren’t fully finished. There is a calendar on the home page that currently includes announcements and a list of activities for each particular day. During class, I can display the slide that has the list of activities for the day. Right now, that list does not link to anything. I will need to find a way to link each activity to whichever location on my website explains how to do that activity and provides resources for it. I think it would be helpful for the link to open up in a new tab.  
    </p>
    <h3><a href="#navigation">Return to top.</a></h3>
<h2 id="changes">Proposed Changes</h2>
    <h3>Reduce number of use cases.</h3>
    <p>Based on a recommendation from the instructor, I am changing my number of use cases to just three. My reasoning is that it will be more manageable in the timeframe of this class. This change will improve my website because it will allow me to focus more on depth, not breadth. I will have time to make sure the three use cases are fully supported.
    </p>
    <h3>Configure target attribute "_blank" value.</h3>
    <p>Based on feedback from the instructor, I am changing the target of my links. The links to Twitter, Facebook, Book Club, and Reading Counts should open in a new window. My reasoning is that it will be easier for the users to navigate back to the website by just closing a tab. This change will improve my website because there won’t be any issues with using the back button.
    </p>
    <h3>Keep navigation the same.</h3>
    <p>Based on survey results, the lowest average score (4) was given in response to the prompt, “Useful content is embedded no further than two layers deep.” Even though my content is mostly embedded three layers deep, I am not going to change my navigation because most users said the site was easily and quickly navigable. One evaluator even mentioned, “Most were 3 layers deep, but I did not find that to be a negative at all, rather logical.” I think changing my navigation to be only two layers would not be an improvement at all. The navigation bars would be too large. 
    </p>
    <h3>Change colors of calendar slides.</h3>
    <p>Based on a peer’s comment on the class discussion board, I am going to change the color scheme of my calendar. My reasoning is that the colors of each slide should match the colors cheme of the website. This change will improve the cohesiveness of everything on my website. 
    </p>
    <h3>Link calendar activities to website sections.</h3>
    <p>Based on my own reflection of the use cases, I am going to link each activity on the calendar to the appropriate section of my website. My reasoning is that it will be easier for a teacher or student to jump from the daily agenda (on the calendar) to the actual directions or resources needed for an activity (elsewhere on the website). This change will improve my website because it will eliminate the need for users to click through navigation from one to the other. It will save time and take them to exactly what they need.
    </p>
    <h3>Add captions and copyright info to footer on each page.</h3>
    <p>Based on feedback from both the instructor and two evaluators, I am going to make a few changes to my footer section on each page. First, I will make sure the same footer is on each and every page. Second, underneath each image link, I will add a caption. Third, I will add copyright information stating that all the images used were created by me. My reasoning for these footer changes include consistency, accessibility, and credibility. Having the footer on each page with image captions will improve users’ ability to access the links and information in the footer. Adding copyright information will improve my website’s credibility. 
    </p>
    <h3>Add a "Contact Me" page to main navigation bar.</h3>
    <p>Based on comments from two evaluators that mentioned it was difficult to find author, contact, and email information, I am going to add a page called “Contact Me”. My reasoning is that it will be quicker and easier for those who don’t know (or don't’ want to) scroll to the bottom to find my contact information. This change will improve my website because not only will it be quicker and easier, but I can add details about when and how to contact me (plan time, school hours, prefer email over phone, etc.) 
    </p>
    <h3>Change size and spacing of title and main navigation.</h3>
    <p>Based on the results from the survey and peer discussion, I am going to change some of the spacing around my H1 title and main navigation bar. My reasoning is that when the page is resized or viewed on a different device, the sizes don’t stay proportionate. This change will improve my website’s readability across multiple devices and browser sizes. 
    </p>
    <h3>Keep font families the same.</h3>
    <p>I decided not to change the font, even though one peer mentioned a distracting “N”. My reasoning is that eventually, the main title will be changed to “ELA with Mrs. J”. This title does not include the letter “N.” Since the majority of evaluators thought positively of the font, it will remain the same. 
    </p>
    <h3>Increase the size of smaller text.</h3>
    <p>One particular user said some of the smaller text was hard to read. I may try to follow up and find which text she was referring to. My reasoning for making it larger is that if it is hard for her, it may be hard for others. This change will improve my website’s readability. 
    </p>
    <h3>Search for and fix typos.</h3>
    <p>Although most evaluators did not mention any mistakes in terms of grammar, spelling, or punctuation, one did. I will try to follow up with him or her and find the errors he or she was referring to. My reasoning is that, as a writing teacher, my conventions should be spot on! This change will improve my website’s credibility. 
    </p>
    <h3>Add a "Parents and Visitors" page to main navigation bar.</h3>
    <p>Two people who evaluated the website mentioned that, as a parent, they could see how the website is a bit overwhelming and has almost too much content. I think one way to keep parents and visitors from viewing the site as “a lot” is to make a separate page just for them. My reasoning is that they will be less intimidated by a page free of educational acronyms, teacher jargon, etc. The information will be presented in a simple, straightforward way with only the basics of what they want to know (links to pictures, due dates, specific skill practice, contact info, etc.). This change will improve my website’s overall feeling for parents and visitors. I want them to be comfortable with the information and not feel “lost” in all the day to day information that teachers and students need.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="#navigation">Return to top.</a></h3>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection on Evaluation Process</h2>
<p>The whole evaluation process was extremely useful, more so than I originally had thought it’d be. Having peers make observations about my website was useful because they were able to identify a few small details I had missed. The surveys with end users was much more valuable than I was expecting. I am glad that I received feedback from both students and parents as well as teachers. Parents provided insight to some things I had not thought about, such as the site being a bit “much” to those not familiar with educational terms and activities. This really opened my eyes to the need for a way to make all users feel comfortable navigating and accessing the site’s content. I learned that it is important to make sure I have input from all end users, even if they aren’t the main target audience. The thought never crossed my mind that the website might be overwhelming to parents. Therefore, I am very thankful for this evaluation process. Another big takeaway was the fact that I need to slow down and make sure I receive feedback for every part of the project. I am the type of person who likes to rush into things and complete everything as soon as possible. If I had finished more pages, I would have had to go back and make even more changes. I am thankful for this step because it forced me to slow down and make sure I finalize the details before creating all of the rest of the pages.
