<h1>Hannah Johnson's Design Document</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This website will be for my sixth-grade classroom. 
    The purpose is to provide a central location for classroom resources such as lessons, practice activities and assessments. 
    One goal is to provide teachers a bank of grade-level materials. Teachers will visit this website to plan and implement lessons and activities in the classroom. 
    Using this website provides teachers the benefit of flexibility to pick and choose quickly from a variety of pre-made lessons. 
    Another goal of this website is to provide students with materials. 
    Students will visit this website in class to complete the activities and also visit the website at home for extra practice. 
    Using this website provides students the benefit of personalization, some degree of choice and individual pacing since most activities can be done independently. 
    The last main goal is to provide parents and community members with resources. 
    Parents will visit the website in order to find useful information and activities for extra practice for their children at home or to take a peek into our daily classroom activities. 
    Using this website provides parents the benefit of quickly finding resources that directly align with what their child is doing in class. 
    Also, there is the benefit of building parent-teacher relationships through the various media and classroom communication tools on the website. </p>
<h2>Use Cases:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>A teacher (myself or co-teacher) wants to have a designated spot for each facet of the classroom. Announcements are posted on the home page above a calendar. The calendar has links to the activities for that particular day. Each link takes the teacher to a specific section of a specific page. Each activity (lesson, practice, assessment, etc.) has an assigned point value (EX: +10) which stands for approximately how much time that activity should take. Also, the number serves as participation points students can earn for completing the activity. 
        </li>
    <li>A teacher (outside of my classroom) wants to find a digital copy of a worksheet on summarizing. He or she would go to the appropriate page from the main navigation menu (reading). Then, he or she would use the sub navigation menu (icons) to select “skills”. That would take him or her to a new page with a new sub navigation menu. He or she would select “summarizing” and be taken to a section of the page that contains resources for that skill. After clicking on whichever worksheet best fits the need, the link will take him or her to a digital copy of the worksheet to print or assign. 
        </li>
    <li>A student wants to complete today’s assignment. The student would go to the home page, find the calendar with links to today’s activities. The link would take him or her to a specific section of a specific page. The student would then read the directions for the activity, look at examples if needed, explore resources, and use the links to complete the activity. When he or she is ready to turn it in, there will be a button on the main navigation menu called “Turn In Work”. This will link to a Google Form which allows the student to attach his or her work and submit.
        </li>
    <li>A student wants to find a game to play to practice a skill. The student would go to the appropriate page from the main navigation menu (writing). Then, he or she would use the sub navigation menu (icons) to select “skills”. That would take him or her to a new page with a new sub navigation menu. He or she would select “editing” and be taken to a section of the page that contains resources and games for that skill. After clicking on a game that best fits the interest of the student, the link will take him or her to that game to play and practice. 
        </li>
    <li>A parent or student wants to find information about a due date. He or she would go to the home page and view the calendar.
        </li>
    <li>A parent or absent student wants to find out what was done in class that day. He or she would go to the home page and view the interactive calendar. Today’s date box will include a list of the activities done in class as well as links to those specific activities. </li>
    <li>A parent wants to find resources to help a struggling student with a certain skill. He or she would go to the appropriate page from the main navigation menu (writing). Then, he or she would use the sub navigation menu (icons) to select “skills”. That would take him or her to a new page with a new sub navigation menu. He or she would select “revising for word choice” and be taken to a section of the page that contains resources, lessons, and practice activities for that skill. 
        </li>
    <li>He or she would go to the appropriate page from the main navigation menu (Follow Us). Then, he or she would use the sub navigation menu (icons) to select “photos”. He or she would be taken to a section of the page that contains a photo gallery or embedded slideshow.
        </li>

<h2>Audience:</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website will mainly be my sixth-grade literature and language students. A mix of middle-school males and females aged 11-12 who live in Oakville, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Most students have internet access at home, and all of them have access to a classroom set of Chromebooks at the school. About half of my students have their own cell phones that can connect to the internet as well. They are mostly proficient with the computer, but are still practicing and perfecting their typing and navigational skills. As for hobbies, my students enjoy team sports such as soccer, hockey, football, and volleyball. Some of my female students participate in cheer and/or dance. Video and computer games are popular as well. Many students love socializing and spending time on social media apps. They have an odd sense of humor, enjoy talking about the latest music, movies, fashion, pop culture, and trends. 
    </p>
<h2>Needs Assessment:</h2>
<p>I sent an optional survey to all my sixth-grade students, and a few of them provided me with some helpful feedback for my website. I also surveyed fellow sixth-grade teachers, and a few parents. The following summarizes the questions and responses:
    </p>
<h3>Which one best describes you?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>7 students</li>
        <li>1 parent</li>
        <li>3 teachers</li>
        </ul>
<h3>Why is a classroom website important to you?</h3>
           <ul><li>“It is going to be easier to get to and locate things.”</li>
            <li>“To see what my child is learning -- and to see pictures.”</li>
            <li>“It is great to have to show information to parents and post links.”</li>
            <li>“Cause it have everything we need.”</li></ul>
<h3>How often would you use a class website?</h3>
        <ul><li>Students responded with “every day” and “when I’m in your class”.</li>
        <li>Parents responded “once a week - or every other week - just to check in”.</li>
        <li>Teachers responded anywhere between once a day to once a week.</li></ul>
<h3>What specific things would you want to see on a class website?</h3>
        <ul><li>Students mainly wanted to see games. One student mentioned writing prompts.            </li>
        <li>Parents wanted to see pictures, announcements, a calendar with due dates, and links to helpful sites to use when a child is struggling.</li>
        <li>Teachers wanted to see assignments and “a designated spot for each facet of my classroom”. </li></ul>
<h3>How could I set it up so that it is easy to find things quickly?</h3>
    <ul><li>Some suggestions included alphabetical order, putting things in respective categories, making a folder for everything, tabs at the top, app-like buttons, images/symbols to click on, and a table of contents. </li></ul>    
<h3>What colors or styles would make it interesting to look at for middle-school students, their parents, and teachers?</h3>
    <ul><li>Blues and greens came up most often.</li></ul>
<h3>Any other thoughts, comments, suggestions, or ideas for a class website?</h3>
        <ul><li>“Add a page for the next library day, collaboratory day, and other important days.”</li>
            <li>“Keep it simple and in parent language - avoid using teacher terminology.”</li>
            <li>“Ability to turn in work digitally like a Google Form with attachments.”</li></ul>
<h2>Five Reference Websites:</h2>
<p>These sites include examples of functions that I am considering for my final design. </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brightscout.com/bots.html">https://www.brightscout.com/bots.html</a> This particular page has a sub navigation menu that utilizes image icons with brief descriptions underneath. I plan on using a similar setup for each page’s sub navigation menu. The visual simplicity will appeal to my students and be very easy for them to navigate.
        </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.brightscout.com/bots.html">https://www.brightscout.com/bots.html</a>Scrolling farther down the page, you’ll see sections such as “Chatbots” and “Conversational Interface”. I will use a similar layout with each activity section of a page. I will have a title, subtitle, paragraph with instructions, and a visual or graphic on the left or right.  </li>
    <li><a href="https://thegoatlocker.net/services/end-of-arm-tooling/">https://thegoatlocker.net/services/end-of-arm-tooling/</a> This page uses a similar color scheme. I like the use of black, white, and gray with pops of a bright color. Since most people I surveyed prefer blue or green, I believe I will use black, white, and gray with pops of bright blue and bright green. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.petrocompletions.com/index.php">http://www.petrocompletions.com/index.php</a> This website has a well-organized home page I’d like to mimic. The main navigation bar at the top is easily navigable. I like how a color background is used when you hover over a link. Just like the website listed above, this one also depicts a color scheme similar to one I’d like to use. </li>
    <li><a href="http://redrussak.com/">http://redrussak.com/</a> This page shows what I want each section of a page to look like. Each section will have a title of the activity, a list of directions, links to resources, and an illustration or doodle of some sort. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Content Organization and Rationale:</h2>
<p>The website will be organized using a hierarchical structure. 
    Each main topic will have its own page that is easily accessible through the website’s main navigation bar. 
    This main navigation bar will stay the same across the entirety of the website for easy navigation. 
    Each page will also have a sub-navigation menu that will quickly connect the user to the chosen content. 
    This sub-navigation menu will be organized alphabetically using image icons and short titles. 
    Images are used because most students respond well to visuals and graphics. 
    To provide a consistent look and feel across all pages and to give my audience a sense of connected fluidity in my site, 
    all pages will contain a formatted heading at the top of each page that will provide the page name, 
    a main navigation menu utilizing a horizontal unordered list, a sub-navigation menu of image icons in alphabetical order that link to sections on that particular page, 
    and formatted sections of content that include a link back to the top. <br> Here is a <a href="files/text-outline.pdf">text outline</a> and <a href="images/wireframe.png">wireframe</a> of my organized website.
    </p>
<h2>Media and Rationale:</h2>
<p>All images for my sub-navigation menus will be images I create using an online program called SketchPad. 
    Using my own icons, sketches, and comics will add a fun element to the website and showcase my classroom’s personality. 
    Audio and video clips will be ones that I record or create using my own recording device (cell phone, classroom digital camera, or screen-recording software). 
    Photographs of students and/or student work will only be posted with parent permission. I’ll include a footer statement such as “All images used in this site are original. 
    Any further use of these images is prohibited without permission from the photographer.” Specific details for the media I include are listed in the <a href="files/text-outline.pdf">text outline</a> and <a href="images/wireframe.png">wireframe</a>.</p>
<h2>Color Scheme and Rationale:</h2>
<p>Since this page is mainly for middle-school students, I will use a web-friendly color scheme composed of neutrals and pops of blue since the majority of students prefered blue. 
    Blue is also known to be relaxing which is important for students who can become stressed with difficult assignments. 
    The purpose of using these colors is to add interest, but not be too overwhelming. The title of my website will be an image I create using the colors. 
    The background will be white with doodles around the edges in all of the colors. The main navigation menu’s text will be #242424. 
    When links are hovered over, the text will either change colors or be underlined with the color #7dd0b6. 
    The sub-navigation menu will include image icons that have a white background. 
    The images themselves will be created with a combination of all the colors. 
    The figure caption for each will be in #2342424. Each section will have a white background. 
    The text will be #242424. Links and images will be a variety of all <a href="images/color-scheme.png">these colors</a>.</p>
