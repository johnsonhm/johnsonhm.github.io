<h1>Hannah Johnson's Basic Webpage</h1>
<h2>Option 1: ELA6</h2>
<p>
    My first idea is to develop a website for my sixth-grade ELA students to use on a daily basis. 
    It would be a central location for all of my classroom resources and activities. All the pages would revolve around the idea of gamifying my classroom.
    Here are some page ideas:
    <ul>
        <li>Quest Menu: A list of quests. One for each reading and writing skill.</li>
        <li>Meet Your Team: Directions and resources for students to find their home base, come up with a team name, complete a teambuilder activity, participate in a discussion, and fill out an adventure log.</li>
        <li>Prepare Your Mind: Directions and resources for students to read about growth mindset, study habits, participate in a discussion, and fill out an adventure log.</li>
        <li>Gather Intel: Directions and resources for students to learn about a specific reading or writing skill, participate in a discussion, and fill out an adventure log. (Each skill would have its own "Gather Intel" page.)</li>
        <li>Battle Practice: Directions and resources for students to play and practice a specific reading or writing skill, participate in a discussion, and fill out an adventure log. (Each skill would have its own "Battle Practice" page.)</li>
        <li>Regroup: Directions and resources for students to go back and correct their previous assessment, participate in a discussion, and fill out an adventure log.</li>
        <li>Learn from Leaders: Directions and resources for students to research a STEM career, describe how it uses that particular reading or writing skill, participate in a discussion, and fill out an adventure log.</li>
        <li>Create a Challenge: Directions and resources for students to create their own practice activity for the particular skill and fill out an adventure log.</li>
        <li>Defeat the Boss: Directions and resources for students to take an assessment for the particular skill and fill out an adventure log.</li>
        <li>Reading Guide: Directions and resources for students to browse book club books, choose their top three, look at an overview, ask and answer questions by posting to FlipGrid, take a Reading Counts Quiz, and explore their books. </li>
        <li>Writing Guide: Directions and resources for students to work through each step of the writing process. </li>
        <li>Adventure Log: Link to a Google Form that students fill out at the end of class where they summarize the day's learning.</li>
        <li>Leaderboard: Display of each class's total experience points (XP) as well as the top ten students (using avatar names) for each class.</li>
        <li>Item Shop: Display a list of items and rewards students can "purchase" by trading in their XP.</li>
        <li>Visitors: Information for parents or teachers.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Option 2: Agents of Change</h2>
<p>
    My second idea is to develop a website for parents, teachers, and other community members to inform them about <a href="https://hannahshomeroom.wordpress.com/2017/12/07/agents-of-change-an-ela-stem-project/">Agents of Change</a>. This is a year-long STEM project I created for my ELA classroom. All the pages would have revolve around the details of this project. Here are some page ideas:
    <ul>
        <li>Overview: Introduce the mission and steps of the project. (How can we use our communication, critical thinking, and collaboration skills to create something that makes our world more awesome?</li>
        <li>Step 1: List problems. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 2: Choose a topic. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 3: Form teams. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 4: Initial research. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.) </li>
        <li>Step 5: Invite an expert, or community partner to help collaborate. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 6: Project idea and overview. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 7: Project plan of action and timeline. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 8: Request permissions and supplies. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 9: Advertise and promote your project. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 10: Do it, collect data, document evidence of journey. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 11: Analyze impact of project on community. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Steo 12: Prepare to share. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 13: Invitations for Celebration Convention. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 14: Practice presentations. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>Step 15: Celebration Convention. (Information, pictures, lesson plans, resources, etc.)</li>
        <li>In the News: Articles, photos, and links to news coverage of this project. I will include information about Samsung's Solve for Tomorrow contest.</li>
        <li>FAQ / Tips: Answers to frequently asked questions, or tips for other teachers to implement this project.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>In Addition...</h2>
<blockquote>
    This is a link to a website I've created for my students this year.<br>
    It's called <a href="https://johnsonhm.github.io/ela6/reading-guide.html">ELA6</a> 
    until I can think of a better name for it. <br>
    I've been using it to play around with different ideas for my final site.
