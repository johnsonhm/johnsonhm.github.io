            <p class="content" style="color:black;first-letter:">My learning journey can be compared to the familiar framework of Bloom's Taxonomy. As I progressed through the program, my knowledge, skills, and abilities climbed up the pyramid, resulting in higher forms of my thinking and learning.</p>
            <h2 style="color:black;">From the Bottom</h2>
            <p class="indent" style="color:black;">My work in this program has equipped me with the knowledge and skills to not only <span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">remember</span> how to design and develop learning technologies, but also to evaluate and reflect upon those learning systems. The courses within this program, which were delivered 100% online, provided excellent examples and helped me <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">understand</span> what an effective elearning experience should be. Working full time as a classroom teacher while participating in this program allowed me to immediately <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">apply</span> my learning to a real-world context and gave a deeper meaning and purpose to the projects I completed. </p>
            <h2 style="color:black;padding-top:0;">To the Top</h2>
            <p class="indent" style="color:black;">Moving forward, no matter my career path, I will use the skills that I have developed to the best of my ability. Whatever learning technologies I interact with, I will actively work to <span style="color:lime; font-weight:bold;">analyze</span>, <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">evaluate</span>, and reflect on these systems. If a need for improvement is identified, I will consider it my responsibility to formally or informally <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">design</span> and develop the necessary components. I will strive to repeat this process until it becomes a habit, for the cycle of design and development never truly ends. Improvement is not just a goal for technology. It is a goal for any system, any process, any area of life. </p>
