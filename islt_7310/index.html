    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Hannah Johnson. I live in O’Fallon, Missouri, with my husband and two rescue dogs, Layla and Luna. I have been a sixth-grade English Language Arts teacher for 7 years, having earned a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education from Missouri State University as well as a certification for Language Arts grades 5 through 9. Additionally, I have experience teaching remedial and enrichment middle school classes during the summer including both online and in-person courses. I began my online master’s program through the University of Missouri in the Spring of 2018 and will graduate in the Fall of 2020. I chose Learning Technologies and Design because I have always had a passion for technology and how it can be used efficiently and effectively to enhance education. My long-term goal is to obtain a job as an instructional designer or educational technology specialist for a school district or educational technology company.</p>
    <p>Please explore my portfolio to learn how I have met the goals and objectives of the program. The artifacts and reflections I have included demonstrate what I have learned and how I have mastered the required competencies.</p>
