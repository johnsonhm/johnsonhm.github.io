    Hi, I’m Hannah Johnson. I am a sixth-grade teacher from St. Louis, MO. I am married and have two rescue dogs, Layla and Luna. This class is one of my last three classes to take before graduating in December. I previously took ISLT 7360 which was an introduction to web development. It’s been awhile since I’ve used HTML and CSS. I would love to develop a website that can serve as my portfolio requirement for graduation. I am hoping to solidify my experience with HTML and CSS so I can use it in the future to build websites. I am a tech trainer for my district, and I can definitely see the possibility of creating websites that will help teachers learn new tools to use in their classrooms. Some of my hobbies include reading and fishing. (We have a large neighborhood pond by our house.) I also love to go thrift-store shopping and complete a lot of DIY-Pinterest projects.
